### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I working as a back-end developer at Veridyen. But I'm not limited to my job title. Sometimes you can see me as a front-end developer or linux system administrator or project manager. The reason why I don't call myself a Full-Stack developer is that I'm only happy when I work as a back-end developer.

My tech stacks are: Laravel, Lumen, Slim Framework, CodeIgniter, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Bash Scripting, GNU Linux Distributions. Also, other things about the a hosting company skills like as control panels (cpanel, plesk), apache, nginx, litespeed softwares, networking, security etc.
